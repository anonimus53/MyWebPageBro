    <h1>The Forest needs your Help!</h1>

    <p>
    We are losing forests at a rate of 27 football fields a minute.<br>
    That is a startling number.<br> But the biggest problem for the world’s forests
    is not the outright clearing of forests, known as deforestation.<br> 
    It is degradation. Degraded forests are a problem, as they reduce their efficiency
    in keeping air and water clean,<br> in providing wildlife with shelter and food,
    or in capturing carbon.

    the trees standing in their places, the rocks and the earth…<br> 
    they are always different too, as lights and shadows and seasons and moods pass through them.”
